                <p><br>There is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average</br>
                    Human being to supply any given army on any given day.</br>
                    
                    <br>And the best at murder are those who preach against it.
                    And the best at hate are those who preach love.
                    And the best at war finally are those who preach peace.</br>
                    
                    <br> Those who preach god, need god.
                    Those who preach peace do not have peace.
                    Those who preach peace do not have love.</br>
                    
                    <br>Beware the preachers.
                    Beware the knowers.
                    Beware those who are always reading books.
                    Beware those who either detest poverty.
                    Or are proud of it.
                    Beware those quick to praise.
                    For they need praise in return.
                    Beware those who are quick to censor.
                    They are afraid of what they do not know.
                    Beware those who seek constant crowds for
                    they are nothing alone
                    Beware the average man, the average woman.
                    Beware their love, their love is average.
                    Seeks average.</br>
                    
                    <br>But there is genius in their hatred.
                    There is enough genius in their hatred to kill you.
                    To kill anybody.
                    Not wanting solitude.
                    Not understanding solitude.
                    They will attempt to destroy anything
                    that differs from their own.
                    Not being able to create art,
                    they will not understand art.
                    They will consider their failure as creators,
                    only as a failure of the world.
                    Not being able to love fully,
                    they will believe your love incomplete,
                    and then they will hate you,
                    and their hatred will be perfect.</br>
                    
                    <br>Like a shining diamond.</br>
                    <br>Like a knife.</br>
